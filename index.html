                            I am an aspiring MERN Full Stack Web Developer who recently completed the six month Georgia Technical College certification course for this subject. My skills lay in the ability to learn and master new skills on the spot or while working on the job. No skill or idea is too much for me to handle.
                            <br\>
                            Currently, I work as the Head of Technical Knowledge for an on-site corporate IT support help desk at Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG). I started as a regular technician out of a technical college and was given no training for the position. Within two years I was valued as the most able source of knowledge for the Americas region. My responsibilities for this position include, but not limited to:

                            <li>Resolve end-user issues through means of hardware, software, or operating system repair</li>
                            <li>Escalate issues, if necessary, with detailed information and offer informed potential resolutions</li>

                        I look to push myself everyday to learn more and master my skills. Following the completion of the Web Developer course I used my knowledge to learn Windows PowerShell scripting and create a text based menu system to assist in automating my groupâ€™s everyday work. I am seeking other opportunities that will push me to do and learn more everyday. A day without learning is a day lost.
